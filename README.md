# Airbnb Template (Front-end)

The Airbnb Website Template for the mobile application displays my ability to be able to create a website for a product from scratch.  Making sure to focus on a modern, sleek, and user-friendly experience, the Airbnb Website tries to grab the users attention to download the mobile application.

You can test it on my [live demo].

## Planned Features
  - Integrate Javascript to allow the user to click on the routing links to be able to fully download the application.

## Personal Insight
> The Airbnb Mobile App Template is a personal achievement of mine because I was able to build the front-end site of a product to grab the eye of the user. Making sure to keep everything looking modern, I was able to create a site that could potentially pass as an official Airbnb Website.  

> After fully implementing all front-end features, I made a few changes to make the user experience a bit smoother, for example with load times.
